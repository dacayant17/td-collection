My solution uses multiple functions and lots of switch statements to solve
this homework problem. I used a looping function for all of the inputs,
which would check if the input from the keyboard was the correct type. If
the input was the correct type, the program would move on, and if it wasn't, 
the program would loop again and ask for another input. To make it easier to
change the given values, I set up multiple smaller functions to be called, 
which made it easier to recieve and change inputs that were given. I believe 
that my solution solves the homework problem because it is able to take 4 
different inputs, handle incorrect types of inputs, and make sure that the 
inputs are also within a certain range. Along with that, after the initial 
inputs are recieved, the program is able to set up a basic menu that has 
5 options, ranging from accessing current pay to quitting the program.  This
menu is also able to handle incorrect inputs without causing an error, as well
as end the program without issues. Regarding the current pay option, the 
solution handles both the exact and whole number values without issues, and 
properly rounds and casts the correct variable. A ternary operator is used for
the manager flag, salary employees are handled correctly, and the employee ID
is also unchangable once set. The directions for the homework are properly 
followed, and the spacing and indentation does not make the code unreadable.
