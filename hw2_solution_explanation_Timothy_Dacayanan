My approach to this homework problem was to first handle the inputs, and assign variables.
Next, I set up an if statement to handle the potential negative values in the inputs.
After, the program will enter a while loop to increase the engine temperature until it reaches the required temperature for take off.
If the difference between the engine temperature is not smaller than 1.25, the engine temperature just increases by 1.25, time increases by 1, and the program will wait for 1 second.
Otherwise, the change in temperature is the remaining values, down to the decimals.
After the required temperature is reached, a final result with the seconds passed, the amount of fuel used, and the amount of fuel leftover is printed.
